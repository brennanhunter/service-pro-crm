## ü§ñ AI COLLABORATION BEST PRACTICES

*Added based on successful development session - these patterns significantly improve efficiency and reduce errors*

### Core Principles for Working with AI Assistants

**1. Always Ask to See Files First**
- Never let AI guess at your code structure
- Ask: "Can you show me your current [specific file]?" 
- Example: "Show me your dashboard page" instead of assuming the structure

**2. Understand Current Patterns Before Suggesting Changes**
- Look at working code to understand existing patterns
- Match new code to established conventions
- Don't reinvent what's already working

**3. Debug Data Step-by-Step**
- Use console.log to see actual data structures
- Check API responses vs. frontend expectations
- Verify assumptions with real data

**4. Communication Patterns That Work**
- AI: "Before I code this, let me see your [file]"
- Human: "Here's the exact error/file/structure"
- AI: "I can see the issue is X, here's the minimal fix"

**5. What to Share With New AI Assistants**
- This development log (provides full context)
- Specific error messages (copy/paste verbatim)
- Exact file contents (don't paraphrase)
- Current working state vs. desired state

**6. Red Flags to Avoid**
- AI jumping straight to coding without seeing existing code
- Making assumptions about file structure or naming
- Suggesting complex solutions without understanding simple fixes
- Not asking follow-up questions about unclear requirements

### When AI Should Slow Down and Ask Questions
- "What does your current [component] look like?"
- "Can you show me the API response structure?"
- "How do you envision this working?"
- "Do you have any existing [related] components?"

### Development Session Structure That Works
1. **Context**: Share development log and current goal
2. **Discovery**: AI asks to see relevant files
3. **Understanding**: AI explains what they see and proposes approach
4. **Implementation**: Minimal changes that fit existing patterns
5. **Testing**: Verify changes work with real data

*This approach reduced debugging time by ~80% and eliminated multiple revision cycles.*

## üóÇÔ∏è KEY FILES & ARCHITECTURE

### Database Layer
- **`prisma/schema.prisma`** - Complete database schema
  - Business table (multi-tenant root)
  - Users table (linked to businesses via Supabase user.id)
  - Customers table (business-specific)
  - Services table (service tickets)
  - ServiceUpdates table (ticket communication using userId field)
  - Invoices table (billing)

- **`lib/database.ts`** - Database utilities
  - Prisma client singleton
  - Supabase client setup (server + admin)
  - TenantContext class for business-isolated queries
  - Helper functions for multi-tenant operations

### Authentication
- **`lib/auth.ts`** - Client-side auth functions
  - signInWithEmail() - Login functionality
  - signUpWithEmail() - Registration + database user creation
  - signOut() - Logout functionality
  - Uses NEXT_PUBLIC_ environment variables for client-side

### API Routes
- **`app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`** - Creates users in database after Supabase signup
- **`app/api/dashboard/route.ts`** - Returns business data for authenticated users
- **`app/api/user/business/route.ts`** - Gets current user's business info
- **`app/api/services/create/route.ts`** - Creates new service tickets ‚úÖ

### Frontend Pages
- **`app/login/page.tsx`** - Login/signup form with toggle
- **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`** - Main business dashboard with working service creation
- **`app/auth-test/page.tsx`** - Authentication status checker
- **`app/test-business/page.tsx`** - Business info display (debug)
- **`app/test-services/page.tsx`** - Service list display (debug)

### Test Data
- **`test.ts`** - Creates sample businesses and data
  - Xtremery Computer Repair (subdomain: xtremery-repair)
  - Central Florida HVAC (subdomain: cf-hvac)
  - Sample customers and service tickets

---

## üîê AUTHENTICATION FLOW

### User Registration Process
1. User fills out form at `/login` (signup mode)
2. `signUpWithEmail()` creates user in Supabase Auth
3. API call to `/api/auth/signup` creates user in Prisma database
4. User assigned to business (currently hardcoded to Xtremery)
5. User given ADMIN role by default

### Login Process
1. User enters credentials at `/login`
2. `signInWithEmail()` authenticates with Supabase
3. Session token stored in browser
4. Dashboard redirects to login if no valid session

### Security Model
- **Client-side:** Uses session tokens for API calls
- **Server-side:** Validates tokens with Supabase service role
- **Database:** All queries filtered by businessId (tenant isolation)
- **Pages:** Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users

### Key Pattern for API Routes
```typescript
// 1. Get auth token from headers
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1]

// 2. Validate with Supabase  
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser(token)

// 3. Find user in database using Supabase user.id (NOT email compound key)
const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: user.id },  // ‚Üê This is the key pattern
  include: { business: true }
})

// 4. Use dbUser.businessId for tenant isolation
```

## üíæ DATABASE SCHEMA DETAILS

### Core Tables Structure
```sql
Business (Multi-tenant root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Users (Business employees/admins) - Primary key: user.id (Supabase auth ID)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Customers (Business clients)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services (Service tickets)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ServiceUpdates (Uses userId field, not createdBy)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Invoices (Billing)
```

### Key Relationships
- Every table has `businessId` foreign key
- Users linked to Supabase auth via `user.id` primary key
- Customers belong to one business  
- Services belong to customer + business
- Perfect tenant isolation maintained

### Sample Data Created
**Xtremery Computer Repair:**
- Admin: Brennan Hunter (brennan@xtremery-repair.com)
- Customer: John Smith
- Service: "Laptop won't boot" (PENDING status)

**Central Florida HVAC:**
- Admin: HVAC Owner
- Customer: Jane Doe  
- Service: "AC not cooling" (PENDING status)

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: Services showing as undefined in console
**Current Status:** Investigating data structure mismatch between API and frontend
**API Returns:** `{business: {...}, services: Array(2), debug: {...}}`
**Frontend Expects:** `data?.services` but getting undefined
**Next Step:** Check how data is being set in component state

### Issue: CORS Errors in Development
**Solution:** Using server-side API routes instead of direct client calls

### Issue: TypeScript Errors with Unknown Types
**Solution:** Added proper type guards and error handling

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Loading
**Solution:** Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side variables

### Issue: Prisma Client Not Generated on Vercel
**Solution:** Added `prisma generate &&` to build script in package.json

---

## üîÑ DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS ESTABLISHED

### API Route Pattern ‚úÖ
```typescript
// 1. Extract auth token from headers
// 2. Validate with Supabase using service role key
// 3. Get user from database using user.id (Supabase auth ID)
// 4. Execute business-scoped query using user's businessId
// 5. Return filtered results
```

### Component Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Client component with 'use client'
// 2. State management with useState
// 3. Auth check with useEffect
// 4. API calls with fetch + auth headers
// 5. Error handling and loading states
```

### Database Query Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Use user.id to find user record (NOT compound key)
// 2. Always include businessId in where clauses for tenant isolation
// 3. Include necessary relations
// 4. Handle errors gracefully
```
