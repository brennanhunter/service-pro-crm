## ü§ñ AI COLLABORATION BEST PRACTICES

*Added based on successful development session - these patterns significantly improve efficiency and reduce errors*

### Core Principles for Working with AI Assistants

**1. Always Ask to See Files First**
- Never let AI guess at your code structure
- Ask: "Can you show me your current [specific file]?" 
- Example: "Show me your dashboard page" instead of assuming the structure

**2. Understand Current Patterns Before Suggesting Changes**
- Look at working code to understand existing patterns
- Match new code to established conventions
- Don't reinvent what's already working

**3. Debug Data Step-by-Step**
- Use console.log to see actual data structures
- Check API responses vs. frontend expectations
- Verify assumptions with real data

**4. Communication Patterns That Work**
- AI: "Before I code this, let me see your [file]"
- Human: "Here's the exact error/file/structure"
- AI: "I can see the issue is X, here's the minimal fix"

**5. What to Share With New AI Assistants**
- This development log (provides full context)
- Specific error messages (copy/paste verbatim)
- Exact file contents (don't paraphrase)
- Current working state vs. desired state

**6. Red Flags to Avoid**
- AI jumping straight to coding without seeing existing code
- Making assumptions about file structure or naming
- Suggesting complex solutions without understanding simple fixes
- Not asking follow-up questions about unclear requirements

### When AI Should Slow Down and Ask Questions
- "What does your current [component] look like?"
- "Can you show me the API response structure?"
- "How do you envision this working?"
- "Do you have any existing [related] components?"

### Development Session Structure That Works
1. **Context**: Share development log and current goal
2. **Discovery**: AI asks to see relevant files
3. **Understanding**: AI explains what they see and proposes approach
4. **Implementation**: Minimal changes that fit existing patterns
5. **Testing**: Verify changes work with real data

*This approach reduced debugging time by ~80% and eliminated multiple revision cycles.*

## üîê AUTHENTICATION FLOW

### User Registration Process
1. User fills out form at `/signup` (dedicated signup page)
2. `signUpWithEmail()` creates user in Supabase Auth
3. API call to `/api/auth/signup` creates user in Prisma database
4. User assigned to business (currently hardcoded to Xtremery)
5. User given ADMIN role by default

### Login Process
1. User enters credentials at `/login`
2. `signInWithEmail()` authenticates with Supabase
3. Session token stored in browser
4. Dashboard redirects to login if no valid session

### Security Model
- **Client-side:** Uses session tokens for API calls
- **Server-side:** Validates tokens with Supabase service role
- **Database:** All queries filtered by businessId (tenant isolation)
- **Pages:** Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users

### Key Pattern for API Routes
```typescript
// 1. Get auth token from headers
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1]

// 2. Validate with Supabase  
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser(token)

// 3. Find user in database using Supabase user.id (NOT email compound key)
const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: user.id },  // ‚Üê This is the key pattern
  include: { business: true }
})

// 4. Use dbUser.businessId for tenant isolation
```

## üíæ DATABASE SCHEMA DETAILS

### Core Tables Structure
```sql
Business (Multi-tenant root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Users (Business employees/admins) - Primary key: user.id (Supabase auth ID)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Customers (Business clients)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services (Service tickets)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ServiceUpdates (Uses userId field, tracks status changes and notes)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Invoices (Billing)
```

### Key Relationships
- Every table has `businessId` foreign key
- Users linked to Supabase auth via `user.id` primary key
- Customers belong to one business  
- Services belong to customer + business
- ServiceUpdates track all changes to services
- Perfect tenant isolation maintained

### Sample Data Created
**Xtremery Computer Repair:**
- Admin: Brennan Hunter (brennan@xtremery-repair.com)
- Customer: John Smith, Hunter
- Services: "Laptop won't boot", "Test" (various statuses)

**Central Florida HVAC:**
- Admin: HVAC Owner

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: Next.js 15 API Route Compatibility
**Solution:** Use async params pattern: `context: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }` and `await context.params`

### Issue: TypeScript Strict Mode Errors
**Solution:** Define proper types instead of using `any`, remove unused variables

### Issue: Brief UI hang during status updates
**Status:** Acceptable for MVP - prevents race conditions and provides user feedback
**Future:** Could add optimistic updates or loading spinners

### Issue: No real-time updates between pages
**Status:** Manual refresh required when data changes
**Future:** Consider WebSocket updates or polling

3. **Check authentication** on every new page/feature
4. **Maintain tenant isolation** in all database queries
5. **Follow established patterns** for consistency
6. **Use TypeScript properly** with defined types, avoid `any`
7. **Keep components modular** for easier iteration and testing

### When Talking to New AI Assistants
1. **Share this document first** for full context
2. **Ask them to see specific files** before they code
3. **Include error messages verbatim** with full stack traces
4. **Specify whether you want to test locally or deploy**
5. **Ask for small, incremental changes** that build on existing patterns
6. **Use the established patterns** shown in this document
